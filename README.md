# Websocket Chat App

How many times have you searched the Github archives for a rudimentary webapp
that uses websockets and encourages interaction?

This real time messenger app uses all of the best things!

****
## Setup
**In order to run this application in your local environment, you must have node installed globally.**

To begin, navigate to this project in the command line and type:

```npm install```

To start a websocket enter the following:
```npm run start-socket```

Then, in a second command line window navigate to the /client folder with:
```cd /client ```

This app utilises Create React App(CRA) for the FE configuration. There is a lot of information readily available on using CRA.
You will find commands for firing up the front end of this app in ./client/README.md
